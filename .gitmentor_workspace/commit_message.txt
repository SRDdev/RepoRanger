refactor: General improvements and transition to GitMentor

This commit introduces several general improvements across the repository, including:

- Renaming `reporanger.yml` to `gitmentor.yml` to reflect the transition to GitMentor.
- Minor edits to documentation and the workflow to reflect the new name and ensure correct configuration.
- Removal of the `.branch_context` file.

These changes aim to improve the overall structure and maintainability of the project and set the stage for more streamlined autonomous code review.
